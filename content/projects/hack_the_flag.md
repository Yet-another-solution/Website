# Hack The Flag

Hack the Flag is a competition for anyone who likes to solve ciphers. The competition aims to promote the world of cryptography and encourage people to learn more about it.

The competition will test your skills in solving ciphers and how quickly you can do it. It will start on November 1st, 2023, and will run for three weeks.

Your goal is to solve as many ciphers as possible and earn as many points as you can. The output of each cipher will be a flag, which you will submit to our website. The flag will look like this: &lt;HTF-this_is_flag&#47;&gt;

If you would like to verify our messages, you can find the key at hacktheflag.net/pgp.
