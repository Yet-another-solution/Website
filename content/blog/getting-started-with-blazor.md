## Introduction

Blazor is Microsoft's web framework that allows developers to build interactive web applications using C# instead of JavaScript. This guide will get you started with your first Blazor application.

## What is Blazor?

Blazor is a free and open-source web framework that enables developers to create interactive web UIs using C#. It offers two hosting models:

- **Blazor Server**: Runs on the server with UI updates sent over SignalR
- **Blazor WebAssembly**: Runs entirely in the browser using WebAssembly

## Why Choose Blazor?

### Unified Development Stack
Use C# for both client and server-side development, reducing context switching between languages.

### Rich Component Model
Build reusable UI components with clear separation of concerns.

### Strong Typing
Get compile-time error checking and excellent IntelliSense support.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **.NET 8 SDK** or later
- **Visual Studio 2022** or **Visual Studio Code**

### Create Your First Project

```bash
dotnet new blazorserver -n MyBlazorApp
cd MyBlazorApp
dotnet run
```

Navigate to `https://localhost:5001` to see your running Blazor application.

## Basic Blazor Component

Here's a simple counter component:

```csharp
@page "/counter"

<h3>Counter</h3>

<p>Current count: @currentCount</p>

<button class="btn btn-primary" @onclick="IncrementCount">Click me</button>

@code {
    private int currentCount = 0;

    private void IncrementCount()
    {
        currentCount++;
    }
}
```

## Key Features

- **Component-based architecture** for building modular UIs
- **Data binding** with automatic UI updates
- **Event handling** with C# methods
- **Dependency injection** built-in
- **Routing** for single-page applications

## Next Steps

Now that you have Blazor running, explore:

1. **Components** - Build reusable UI elements
2. **Data binding** - Connect your UI to data
3. **Services** - Add business logic
4. **Forms** - Handle user input
5. **Authentication** - Secure your app
